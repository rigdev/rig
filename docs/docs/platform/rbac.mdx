# Role Based Access Control

For granular access control, Rig offers Role Based Access Control (RBAC), with four predefined roles,
where a role has a set of permissions that define what actions a user can perform, and on what resources they can perform those actions.

The roles and their permissions are rougly as follows:
- Admin: Can perform all actions on all resources
- Owner: Can do everything a Developer can do, but can also create and delete capsules, delete images, and manage users and their roles.
- Developer: Can do everything a Viewer can do, and can also perform deployments and create new images.
- Viewer: Can view all resources, but cannot perform any actions.

For a more detailed view of the permissions for each role, see the [Role Permissions](#role-permissions) section.

## Manage Users

To manage users, you must be logged in as an Owner or an Admin, navigate to the 'Settings'-tab, and then click the 'Team'-page.

### Add user

To add a user, click the '+ Add member'-button, and enter the email address, a temporary password, and the role you want to assign to the user.
