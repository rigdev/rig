# Github Actions

The [Rig CLI](/getting-started/cli-install) can be used to deploy changes to Capsules to any pipeline.
Additionally for GitHub Actions, there are some built-in GitHub actions that makes it even easier.

## Preparing variables

We recommend that you define the following variables to be available
for Github actions.

- `RIG_HOST` containing the full URL to your Rig API.
- `RIG_CLIENT_ID` containing the client ID of your service account.
- `RIG_CLIENT_SECRET` containing the client secret of your service account.
  This should be stored as a secret variable in Github.

For more information about how to set variables and secrets please refer to the
official Github documentation for
[configuration variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables)
and
[secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

## Setup Step

For easy access to the Rig CLI in any GitHub Actions workflow, use our rig
setup action `rigdev/setup-rig@v1`:

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      # Ensure that the rig CLI is installed and that the service account is
      # activated. This will enable you to use the CLI on behalf of the service
      # account.
      - name: Setup Rig
        uses: rigdev/setup-rig@v1
        with:
          # specify what version of the rig CLI you need. If left empty we use
          # the latest release.
          version: ${RIG_VERSION}
          host: \${{ vars.RIG_HOST }}
          client-id: \${{ vars.CLIENT_ID }}
          client-secret: \${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}
      # With the CLI installed and service account activated you can use the
      # CLI to send commands to the Rig API.
      - run: |
          rig deploy ...`}
</CodeBlock>

Now that you are able to run the `rig` CLI you can either checkout our general
documentation about [using the CLI in CI/CD systems](../ci-cd#deploying-changes) or read through the below
example.

## Example workflow: Build and deploy docker image

This example will show a full GitHub Actions workflow which builds a docker
image, and deploys it using the `rig` CLI.

In the workflow we will go through the following steps

1. Build a Docker image from a new commit
2. Push that Docker image GitHub container registry
3. Deploy the image in to a capsule named the same as the repository in the rig
   project 'my-project' for the production environment.

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`on: [push]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      IMAGE_NAME: "ghcr.io/\${{ github.repository_owner }}/\${{ github.repository }}:\${{ github.sha }}"
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Login to GitHub container registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: \${{ github.actor }}
          password: \${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          push: true
          tags: \${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}

      - name: Setup Rig
        uses: rigdev/setup-rig@v1
        with:
          version: ${RIG_VERSION}
          host: \${{ vars.RIG_HOST }}
          client-id: \${{ vars.RIG_CLIENT_ID }}
          client-secret: \${{ secrets.RIG_CLIENT_SECRET }}

      - name: Deploy Capsule to production
        run: |
          rig deploy \${{ github.repository }} \\
            --project my-project \\
            --environment production \\
            --image \${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}`}
</CodeBlock>
