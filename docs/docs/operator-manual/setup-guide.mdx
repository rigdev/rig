# Setup guide

## Kubernetes Cluster Installation

Rig shines when it gets to run in a real Kubernetes environment. It
lowers the barrier of entry for engineers as they won't have to learn the
complex APIs of Kubernetes.

Rig consists of two components which together gives the full experience of
Rig.dev.

- rig-operator: our open source components which provide higher level APIs in
  kubernetes, which encapsulate multiple low level resources in a single CRD.
- rig-platform: our paid product which further builds on the primitives
  provided by rig-operator.

Each of these components have their own requirements and offer options for
configuration to make it fit into your kubernetes cluster.

## Requirements: rig-operator

The rig-operator uses the kubernetes APIs and a few additional APIs to provide
some very easy-to-use APIs for spinning up workloads.

- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/).
- [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server).

### cert-manager

The rig-operator helm chart uses cert-manager to create a certificate for the
CRD webhooks. These are self-signed and doesn't require any special
configuration of cert-manager.

If you want to enable ingress support, then you will need to further configure
cert-manager and rig-operator to be able to generate certificates for
workloads. See [the section about ingress](/operator-manual/ingress) for more
information about this.

### metrics-server

The rig-operator creates
[`HorizontalPodAutoscaler`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)
resources, configured to use the metrics APIs provided by metrics-server.

In some environments (eg. GKE) this is installed in the kubernetes cluster when
you create it. To check wether the metrics APIs are available run

```bash
kubectl api-resources | grep metrics
```

This should show an output similar to the below if the APIs are available.

```
nodes          metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1       false        NodeMetrics
pods           metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1       true         PodMetrics
```

If you dont see this output you can install the metrics-server using the
[official
instructions](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server#installation).

## Requirements: rig-platform

The rig-platform needs a database for holding its data and the metrics APIs for
showing graphs in the dashboard, and then it needs the rig-operator and the
APIs it provides.

If you installed rig-operator and its requirements, then you already have the
metrics APIs available.

### Database

Support is available for connecting to an existing PostgreSQL or MongoDB
database. Alternatively, a PostgreSQL database can be deployed for you as part
of the installation (not recommended for production environments).

## Installation

We will install the Rig Platform using [Helm](https://helm.sh). This also
installs the Rig Operator, which enables support for Capsules within the
cluster.

<pre><code className="language-bash">{`helm upgrade --install rig-operator rig-operator \\
  --repo https://charts.rig.dev \\
  --version ${RIG_OPERATOR_CHART_VERSION} \\
  --namespace rig-system \\
  --create-namespace
helm upgrade --install rig-platform rig-platform \\
  --repo https://charts.rig.dev \\
  --version ${RIG_PLATFORM_CHART_VERSION} \\
  --namespace rig-system \\
  --create-namespace \\
  --set postgres.enabled=true  # Remove to not start a new PostgreSQL database.
`}
</code>
</pre>

:::info Note
See the [Database](/operator-manual/database) article for more information about how to connect to your
own database, and other configuration options.
:::

After installing the Rig Platform you'll need to run the following command to setup an admin user

```bash
kubectl exec -it --namespace rig-system deploy/rig-platform \
  -- rig-admin init
```

### Configuration

The Rig Operator and Platform both have a `values.yaml` file which specify how
to configure their respective Helm charts. The `values` files and their
defaults can be found here

- [Operator values](https://github.com/rigdev/rig/blob/main/deploy/charts/rig-operator/values.yaml)
- [Platform values](https://github.com/rigdev/rig/blob/main/deploy/charts/rig-platform/values.yaml)

To overwrite a default value when deploying, use `--set FIELD=VALUE` flags when
running `helm`.

### Connect to the Rig Platform remotely
After setting up Rig, users who want to connect to it remotely can run the following command using their local Rig CLI
```bash
rig config init
```
which will guide the user trough connecting to Rig.
