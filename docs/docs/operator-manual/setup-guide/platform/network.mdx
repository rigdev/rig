# Networking

You can configure the platform to spin up an Ingress resource so it can be reached from outside the cluster. This can be done through the `ingress` section of the [Helm values](https://github.com/rigdev/rig/blob/main/deploy/charts/rig-platform/values.yaml) of the platform.

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: rig.example.com
````
