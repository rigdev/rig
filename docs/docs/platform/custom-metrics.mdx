# Custom Metrics Autoscaling

The [Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) also supports custom metrics and Rig can use that as well.
Rig currently supports *Pod Metrics* and *Object Metrics*. Within the Rig ecosystem we call pod metrics for *Instance Metrics*.

To use custom metrics, you need an observability stack installed in your Kubernetes cluster. See the [operator manual](/operator-manual/setup-guide/autoscaler) for details.
