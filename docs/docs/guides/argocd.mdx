# GitOps using Argo CD

When it comes to GitOps, Argo CD is an established approach for consuming Kubernetes objects from a Git repository.

This guide is using the following repository as reference: https://github.com/rigdev/argocd-demo

## Configuring Rig

The Rig Platform will by default apply the Kubernetes objects directly through the Kubernetes API. However, for a GitOps setup, this behavior can be changed.
The first step is thus to follow the guide [here](/operator-manual/gitops#gitops-for-rig-platform-resource-changes) to write the changes to your Git repository instead of Kubernetes directly.

When configuring the cluster, here is an example of using our GitHub repository:

```yaml title="Helm values - Platform"
rig:
  clusters:
    my-cluster:
      git:
        url: https://github.com/rigdev/argocd-demo
        branch: main
        path_prefix: "apps/{{ .Cluster.Name }}/{{ .Project.Name }}/{{ .Capsule.Name }}/"
```

The `path_prefix` is a template for where Capsule-specific resources will be located - this will be important later when configuring Argo CD.

:::info
It's recommended to include the cluster-name in the `path_prefix` path, to allow your repository to be consumed by multiple cluster.

## Setup Repo in Argo CD

In Argo CD, using either the Dashboard, CLI or Kubernetes resources directly, configure you repository. It's recommended to configured it with GitHub webhooks, to accelerate
the time from making changes until Argo CD picks them up. Without webhooks, the default delay is 3 minutes.

  customProps={{
    zoom: true,
  }}
  sources={{
    light: "/img/guides/argo_repo.png",
    dark: "/img/guides/argo_repo.png",
  }}
/>

## Create Rig Application

Next is to create an Application in Argo CD. The Application should be a "directory" type, that can consume raw Kubernetes manifests from a directory - in this case a directory in our repository.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Configure Application in Argo"
  customProps={{
    zoom: true,
  }}
  sources={{
    light: "/img/guides/argo_new_app.png",
    dark: "/img/guides/argo_new_app.png",
  }}
/>

:::info
It's also possible to utilize the Kustomize Application type, as described [here](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/kustomize/).
:::

The raw Application should look similar to this:

```yaml title="Argo CD Application"
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: rig
spec:
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  source:
    path: apps/
    repoURL: https://github.com/rigdev/argocd-demo.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    directory:
      recurse: true
      include: '*'
  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
```

The path we are interested in, should match our `path_prefix` from above. Anything within this subpath will be included, and in our case that would
indeed be anything designated the `my-cluster` cluster.

A few additional notes:
- `recurse` enabled recursive mode, which means all .yaml files in all sub-folders will be consumed.
- `prune` is required to ensure Argo CD deletes resources, as they are deleted by the Rig Platform.


With that in place, the Application should now be able to sync the repository and apply our Capsule resources.
