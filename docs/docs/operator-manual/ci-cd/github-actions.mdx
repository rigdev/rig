# Github Actions

The [Rig CLI](/getting-started/cli-install) can be used to deploy changes to Capsules to any pipeline.
Additionally for GitHub Actions, there are some built-in GitHub actions that makes it even easier.

## Setup Step

For easy access to the Rig CLI in any GitHub Action, use the following step `rigdev/setup-rig@v1`:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Setup Rig
        uses: rigdev/setup-rig@v1

      - run: |
          rig deploy my-capsule ...
```

This step assumes `RIG_CLIENT_ID` and `RIG_CLIENT_SECRET` is configured for the workflow.

### Custom version

To pin the step to fetch a specific version of the CLI, the version can explicitly be configured:

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: rigdev/setup-rig@v1
        with:
          version: 1.7.1
```

The default version is the latest released.

## Deploy using CLI

To deploy using the CLI, the following command can be used:

```yaml
      - name: Deploy to Capsule
        env:
          RIG_HOST: https://my-host/
          RIG_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.RIG_CLIENT_ID }}
          RIG_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.RIG_CLIENT_SECRET }}
        run: |
          rig deploy my-capsule -P my-project -E production --image nginx:1.25
```

## Deploy using Action

Additionally, a pre-built step is available that wraps the CLI and makes deploying even simpler:

```yaml
      - name: Deploy to capsule
        uses: rigdev/actions/deploy@v3
        with:
          url: url-to-rig-cluster
          project: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
          capsule: YOUR_CAPSULE
          image: image-name
```

This step assumes `RIG_CLIENT_ID` and `RIG_CLIENT_SECRET` is configured for the workflow.

## Example workflow using the actions

Rig exposes [two different actions](https://github.com/rigdev/actions), `build` and `deploy`. The `build` action assumes you have a Docker image you want to deploy and makes a Rig build off of it. The `deploy` action can then deploy the previously (or any other) generated build to a capsule.
As you need a Docker image to build and deploy, it is common to prefix these two actions with [Docker Github actions](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/) to build and publish an image.

The following GitHub workflow example showcases how you can

1. Build a Docker image from a new commit
2. Push that Docker image to Docker Hub
3. Make a Rig build from that Docker image
4. Deploy that Rig build to your Rig capsule

In this example a username and password to Dockerhub is stored as a Github secret in the repository of the workflow. The same is done with the client secret to the Rig project

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          file: ./Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME:latest

      - name: Create build on Rig
        uses: rigdev/actions/build@v3
        id: build_rig
        with:
          url: url-to-rig-cluster
          project: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
          clientID: YOUR_ID
          clientSecret: ${{ secrets.RIG_PROJECT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          image: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME:latest
          capsule: YOUR_CAPSULE

      - name: Deploy to capsule
        uses: rigdev/actions/deploy@v3
        with:
          url: url-to-rig-cluster
          project: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
          clientID: YOUR_ID
          clientSecret: ${{ secrets.RIG_PROJECT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          capsule: YOUR_CAPSULE
          build: ${{ steps.build_rig.outputs.build }}
```
