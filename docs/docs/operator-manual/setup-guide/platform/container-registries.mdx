# Container Registries

The Rig platform has support for validating Container Images against registries, extracting digests for safe rollbacks and even generation of pull-secrets for Kubernetes.

By default, the Rig Platform can use Container Images from any public Container Repositories.
For example, when creating a new Build using the repository `nginx`, the Rig Platform will be able to resolve this at the registry `index.docker.io`.

## Private Repositories

When a Container Repository is private, authentication for the Container Registry needs to be added to the Rig Platform.

This is done by adding the credentials of the registry to the platform configuration.

For each registry configured, there are 2 types of configuration;

1. **Username/Password**: This is useful when you have a long-lived credential that does not require 2FA, e.g. a GitHub PAT or GitLab Access Token.
  Here the `username` and `password` values are to be provided:
    ```yaml title="Helm values - Platform"
    rig:
      dockerRegistries:
        index.docker.io:
          username: <registry-username>
          password: <registry-password>
    ```
2. **Script execution**:
    This allows custom scripts to be executed, that can extract credentials from the environment. This is especially useful when Workload Identity Federation is used.
    The `script` field should contain the full script and will be run in the context of the Platform container. Tools like `aws`, `wget` and `curl` are available to the script.
    Additionally, an `expire` field can be given to hint when a credential would become expired; the default is `12h`.
    ```yaml title="Helm values - Platform"
    rig:
      dockerRegistries:
        index.docker.io:
          script: |
            USERNAME="my-username"
            PASSWORD="my-password"
            echo "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD"
          expire: 1h
    ```
    The `script` provided should echo a single line of the format `<username>:<password>`. Anything else will result in an invalid credential and the error being printed in the log output.

When the credentials are used, the credential with the longest prefix will be used, e.g. for the repository `registry.gitlab.com/rigdev/foobar` and credentials are provided for `registry.gitlab.com` and `registry.gitlab.com/rigdev`, the latter will be used.

### Example - AWS Workload Identity Federation

AWS support Workload Identity Federation as explained [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service-accounts.html#service-accounts-iam). When configured, access to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) can
be delegated to the `rig-platform` Kubernetes Service Account. With that in place, the `aws` tool can be used to extract the service account credentials, as shown below.

```yaml title="Helm values - Platform"
rig:
  dockerRegistries:
    XXXXXXXXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:
      script: |
        aws ecr --region "us-west-2" get-authorization-token --output text --query 'authorizationData[].authorizationToken' | base64 -d
      expire: 12h
```

### Example - Google Workload Identity Federation

Google supports Workload Identity Federation as explained [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity). When configured, access to the Artifact Registry can
be delegated to the `rig-platform` Kubernetes Service Account. With that in place, an access token can be fetched for the pod, as shown below.

```yaml title="Helm values - Platform"
rig:
  dockerRegistries:
    us-docker.pkg.dev:
      script: |
        ACCESS_TOKEN=$(wget --header 'Metadata-Flavor: Google' http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token -q -O - | grep -Eo '"access_token":.*?[^\\]",' | cut -d '"' -f 4)
        echo "oauth2accesstoken:$ACCESS_TOKEN"
      expire: 30m
```

## Pull-pull secret generation

By default, the clusters are individually responsible for creating [image-pull-secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-by-providing-credentials-on-the-command-line) for the Kubernetes cluster.

However, if registry credentials are configured in the Rig Platform, image-pull secrets can be automatically generated when needed by enabling it, as shown below.

:::note
Using generation of image-pull secretes is discouraged when
* Using GitOps, as this would put plain-text credential in the git repository.
* Using expirable credentials, as this could result in credential expiration when pods are being preempted.
:::

### Example

Let's imagine that we have the private Container Repository `index.docker.io/rigdev/test-container`, that we want to use in a Capsule.

First, we need the _registry_ section of the repository, which is the `host` part of the url; `index.docker.io`.

Then, using the guide for _this_ registry, available [here](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/), we can see that we can create a new token for our account.

When created, the username and token can be used to register the registry in the Rig Platform configuration:

```yaml title="Helm values - Platform"
rig:
  dockerRegistries:
    index.docker.io:
      username: <registry-username>
      password: <registry-password>

  clusters:
    prod:
      type: k8s
      createPullSecrets: true

```

With this change, the Rig Platform can now generate the image-pull-secrets needed to pull the container.

## Dev Registry

The Rig Platform supports the concept of a _dev_ registry. This registry is used by the CLI when interacting with the platform, to push images directly to a registry, an operation very useful for development.

When starting a local dev cluster (using the `rig dev ...` CLI command), a dev registry is automatically created and registered.

When running the command `rig deploy`, you can access local images and have them automatically pushed to the dev registry as part of deploying the local image:
