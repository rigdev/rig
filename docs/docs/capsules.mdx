![Capsules](/img/banners/capsules-banner.png "Capsules")

Rig comes with a deployment engine that wraps resources in what we call _Capsules_. This is our top level abstraction, and the main way you will interact with Rig. 
Each capsule specifies (in most cases) a single service, and handles the creation and configuration of the kubernetes reasources needed to deploy and run it.

In short, a capsule contains:
- _Builds_ as an immutable abstraction of containerized services.
- Kubernetes resources, such as services, config-files, secrets etc. used to run and scale the capsule.
- A complete history of changes made to the capsule, and the ability to rollback to any previous state.
- An event log of the state of capsules and the their instances.
- An autoscaler to ensure that the capsule is scaled to the required number of replicas.

To see the complete specification of a capsule, see the [Capsule Spec](/operator-manual/crd-operator).
