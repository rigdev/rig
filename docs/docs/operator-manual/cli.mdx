# CLI 

import {RIG_VERSION} from "../../src/constants/versions"

Besides the normal `rig` CLI, we have a `rig-ops` CLI for working with plugins and migration. 

## Installation
The following are the different installation options for the `rig-ops` CLI

## Homebrew
Add the homebrew tap and install the CLI
```
brew install rigdev/tap/rig-ops	
```

## Binaries
The CLI can be installed manually by downloading a precompiled binary and adding it to your `$PATH`.

Every GitHub release has prebuilt binaries for common platforms and architectures. Go to the releases page to find yours.

## From source
Installation from source requires the go toolchain to be installed.
