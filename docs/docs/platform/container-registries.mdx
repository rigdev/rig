# Container Registries

By default, the Rig Platform can use Container Images any public Container Repositories.
For example, when creating a new Build using the repository `nginx`, the Rig Platform will be able to resolve this at registry `index.docker.io`.

## Private Repositories

Then a Container Repository is private, Authentication for the Container Registry needs to be added to the Rig Platform.

This is done through the `Container Registry` tab within the Project Settings.

For Container Registries registered in the Rig Platform, image-pull-secrets will automatically be generated for the Capsules that uses builds from these registries.

### Example

Let's imagine that we have the private Container Repository `index.docker.io/rigdev/test-container`, that we want to use in a Capsule.

First, we need the _registry_ section of the repository, which is the `host` part of the url; `index.docker.io`.

Then, using the guide for _this_ registry, available [here](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/), we can see that we can create a new token for our account.

When created, the username and token can be used to register the registry in the Rig Platform:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dashboard" label="Dashboard">
    <ThemedImage
      alt="Stages of a Rollout"
      customProps={{
        zoom: true,
      }}
      sources={{
        light: "/img/dashboard/platform/container-registries/add-registry.png",
        dark: "/img/dashboard/platform/container-registries/add-registry.png",
      }}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With this change, the Rig Platform can now generate the image-pull-secrets needed to pull the container.

## Dev Registry

The Rig Platform supports the concept of a _dev_ registry. This registry is used by the CLI when interacting with the platform, to push images directly to a registry, an operation very useful for development.

When starting a local dev cluster (using the `rig dev ...` CLI command), a dev registry is automatically created and registered.

When running the command `rig capsule deploy`, you can access local images and have them automatically pushed to the dev registry as part of deploying the local image:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```sh
$ rig capsule deploy -c webserver
Deploy from docker image or existing rig build? Image
Use a local image?
Select image:
Filter: nginx

                           Image name                            Age
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  â–¸ nginx:latest                                             | 7d 23h  |
    nginx:1.25.1                                             | 98d 8h  |
    nginx:1.25.0                                             | 143d 4h |
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
