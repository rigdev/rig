# Deploy your application to a Capsule using Github Actions

In this document, you'll learn how to build and deploy your application automatically using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that you have a Rig Capsule up and running, see [Deploy Your Application](/getting-started/first-capsule) if not. You should also have a GitHub repository from which you would like to build and deploy to your capsule.

## Example workflow using the actions

Rig exposes [two different actions](https://github.com/rigdev/actions), `build` and `deploy`. The `build` action assumes you have a Docker image you want to deploy and makes a Rig build off of it. The `deploy` action can then deploy the previously (or any other) generated build to a capsule. It is also possible to let the `build` action deploy the newly created build to the capsule.
As you need a Docker image to build and deploy, it is common to prefix these two actions with [Docker Github actions](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/) to build and publish an image.

The following GitHub workflow example showcases how you can

1. Build a Docker image from a new commit
2. Push that Docker image to Docker Hub
3. Make a Rig build from that Docker image and deploy it to the capsule

In this example a username and password to Dockerhub is stored as a Github secret in the repository of the workflow. The same is done with the client secret to the Rig project

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          context: .
          file: ./Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME:latest

      - name: Make build and deploy to the Rig capsule
        uses: rigdev/actions/build@v2.1
        id: build_deploy_rig
        with:
          url: url-to-rig-cluster
          project: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
          clientID: YOUR_ID
          clientSecret: ${{ secrets.RIG_PROJECT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          image: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME:latest
          capsule: YOUR_CAPSULE
          deploy: true
```
