# Builds

Builds are a shallow abstraction on top of Container Images.

To create a new build, simply insert the container image and click "Create build". The platform will validate the build against the Container Registry, defaulting to `index.docker.io` if omitted.

If the build fails due to an Authentication error and the Container Registry is private, be sure to check if Authentication is configured for the Container Registry.
See [Container Registries](/platform/container-registries) for more information.

:::info Validation Skip
If the Rig Platform cannot access the Container Registry for some reason, the validation step can be omitted.

### Deploying

To deploy a build, simply click the `Deploy` button for the given build. That will initiate a new Rollout, upgrading the instances to this build.

### Immutability

A Build, when being validated, captures the underlying Image Digest of the Container Image. By capturing this reference, Rig ensure that a Build always point to the same reference of the image. If a Container Image becomes available with the same tag, simply create a new Build using the same Image name and tag, and a new Build will be created with the new Image Digest.
