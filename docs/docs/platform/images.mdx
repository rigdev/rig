# Images

Images are a shallow abstraction on top of Container Images.

To add a new image, enter the [configuration modal](capsules#configuring-a-capsule) and enter the image tab. The platform will validate the image against the Container Registry, defaulting to `index.docker.io` if omitted.

If the image fails due to an Authentication error and the Container Registry is private, be sure to check if Authentication is configured for the Container Registry.
See [Container Registries](../operator-manual/setup-guide/platform/container-registries) for more information.

To deploy a image simply add a new image, or a previsouly deployed one, and click `Deploy Now`. This will initiate a new [Rollout](rollouts), upgrading the instances to this image.

## Immutability

An image, when being validated, captures the underlying Image Digest of the Container Image. By capturing this reference,
Rig ensures that a image always points to the same reference of the image. If a Container Image becomes available with the same tag,
simply create a new image using the same Image name and tag, and a new image will be created with the new Image Digest.
