# CRD & Operator

The foundation of Rig is our Capsule CRD (CustomResourceDefinition). The Rig Operator will spawn all derived Kubernetes resources as defined by a Capsule resource. It will also watch these derived resources and undo any changes applied to them which conflicts with their Capsule parent. Updating these resources can only be done by updating the corresponding capsule spec. The resources we spawn are

- [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
- [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
- [TLS Certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/reference/api-docs/#cert-manager.io/v1.Certificate)
- [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
- [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)

ConfigMaps and Secrets used by a capsule is not owned by the capsule though. These will be created by the Platform and can be updated independently of the capsules. The operator, however, will watch those config files and redeploy instances if configs or secrets they depend on have been changed.

## Capsule Spec

This is a complete example of the `Capsule` CRD spec

```yaml
apiVersion: rig.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Capsule
metadata:
  name: my-capsule
  namespace: default
spec:
  image: nginx:latest
  command: ./somecommand
  args:
    - arg1
    - arg2
  files:
    - path: /etc/config.yaml
  secret:
    key: config.yaml
    name: config
  horizontalScale:
    cpuTarget:
      averageUtilizationPercentage: 80
    minReplicas: 2
    maxReplicas: 5
  interfaces:
    - name: http
      port: 4747
      public:
        loadBalancer:
          nodePort: 30047
          port: 4747
    - name: ingress
      port: 5678
      public:
        ingress:
          host: http://www.example.com
  serviceAccountName: name
```
