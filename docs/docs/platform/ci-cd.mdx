For CI/CD Rig currently supports [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). This doc will show how to build and deploy your application automatically using them.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that you have a Rig Capsule up and running, see [Deploy Your Application](/getting-started/first-capsule) if not. You should also have a GitHub repository from which you would like to build and deploy to your capsule.

## Example workflow using the actions

Rig exposes [two different actions](https://github.com/rigdev/actions), `build` and `deploy`. The `build` action assumes you have a Docker image you want to deploy and makes a Rig build off of it. The `deploy` action can then deploy the previously (or any other) generated build to a capsule.
As you need a Docker image to build and deploy, it is common to prefix these two actions with [Docker Github actions](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/) to build and publish an image.

The following GitHub workflow example showcases how you can

1. Build a Docker image from a new commit
2. Push that Docker image to Docker Hub
3. Make a Rig build from that Docker image
4. Deploy that Rig build to your Rig capsule

In this example a username and password to Dockerhub is stored as a Github secret in the repository of the workflow. The same is done with the client secret to the Rig project

      - name: Deploy to capsule
        uses: rigdev/actions/deploy@v2
        with:
          url: url-to-rig-cluster
          project: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
          clientID: YOUR_ID
          clientSecret: ${{ secrets.RIG_PROJECT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          capsule: YOUR_CAPSULE
          build: ${{ steps.build_rig.outputs.build }}
```
