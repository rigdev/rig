# Cron Jobs Plugin

The `rigdev.cron_jobs` plugin is the default plugin for handling the jobs specified in the `capsule spec` in the reconcilliation pipeline. For each job specified in the capsule spec, if the job is specified by a command, the plugin will create a cron job based on the container of the capsule deployment. Alternatively, if the job is specified by a URL, the plugin will create a cron job that will curl the URL.
