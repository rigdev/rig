# Environments

The Rig Platform supports a multi-environment architecture out-of-the-box. All Capsules in the Platform are
automatically deployable to all environments. That means a single Environment always contains some sub-set of all Platform Capsules.

Each environment has it's own configuration of a given Capsule. Capsule A can e.g. have 10 replicas in `production` but only 2 in `staging`.

<ThemedImage

  customProps={{
    zoom: false,
  }}
  sources={{
    light: "/img/operator-manual/environment-topology.svg",
    dark: "/img/operator-manual/environment-topology-dark.svg",
  }}
/>


Environments are associated to a single cluster, meaning Rig supports multiple clusters
through environments.

## Creating new environments

To create a new environment, use the following CLI command:

```bash
rig env create my-environment my-cluster
```

The newly created environment is immediate available for existing Capsules as a deployment target:

```bash
rig deploy -E my-environment my-capsule --image nginx
```

### Custom namespace templating

By default, Capsules in the new environment will be named after the project. To change this,
a custom namespace template can be provided:

```bash
rig env create my-environment my-cluster \
  --namespace-template '{{ .Project.Name }}-{{ .Environment.Name }}'
```

This example will suffix all namespaces with the environment, allowing multiple environments in a single
namespace.

## Deleting environments

An environment can be deleted with a simple command;

```bash
rig env delete my-environment
```

However, if any Capsules is currently running in the environment, the operation will abort. Use `--force` to override this behavior.

:::warning Force deletion
Force deletion an environment will stop *all* running Capsules in that environment. Use this flag with care.

## Ephemeral environments

Due to the flexible nature of environments, it's very straight forward to implement ephemeral environments with Rig.

1. First, the new environment should be created. This can be based on the pull-request ID, branch-name or something else:

    ```bash
    rig env create "temp-env-$BRANCH_NAME" testing-cluster \
      --namespace-template '{{ .Project.Name }}-{{ .Environment.Name }}'
    ```

2. Next, all capsules that should be running in this environment should be deployed:

    ```bash
    rig deploy -E "temp-env-$BRANCH_NAME" -P my-project my-capsule1 --image nginx
    rig deploy -E "temp-env-$BRANCH_NAME" -P my-project my-capsule2 --image nginx
    ```

3. Finally, when the environment is no longer used, e.g. when a pull-request is closed, the environment can be deleted:

    ```bash
    rig env delete "temp-env-$BRANCH_NAME" --force
    ```
