# Cron Jobs
You can attach [cron jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to a capsule to execute jobs at a user-defined schedule. We support two different kinds of jobs, *bash jobs* and *http jobs*. A bash job spins up a new instance of your capsule whenever it needs to execute a job, runs a job-defined command and then stops the instance. These are good for longer running jobs.

If a job is expected to be quite short-lived, an HTTP job can be used as well. An HTTP job sends a user-defined HTTP request to an existing instance of the capsule. As these jobs are executed entirely within a single HTTP request, they should be able to finish within about a minute.

## Retries and Timeouts

A bash job will be retried if the instance exits with a non-zero exit code and an HTTP job will be retried if it returns a non 2xx status code. You can specify the maximum number of retries, which defaults to 6 (same as for [Kubernetes Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/)).

You can also specify a max total duration. This limits how long a job execution can live (including all retries) until being terminated. If no max duration is specified, a job execution can potentially run indefinitely if it never exits. In this case, multiple job executions for the same job can run concurrently.

## CLI
Jobs can be added through the CLI running
```bash
rig capsule jobs add
```
and a history of past executions seen running
```
rig capsule jobs executions
```

## Under The Hood
Under the hood, the Rig operator spawns Kubernetes [CronJobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) which in turn spawns [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/). For bash jobs, the spawned Job is an instance of your Capsule, and for HTTP jobs it's a lightweight pod using curl to make a request to your capsule.
