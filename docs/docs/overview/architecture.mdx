# Architecture

Rig is a very customizable platform, that allows for a wide range of integrations. At the top, the _Rig Platform_ is connecting together high-level components such as CLI/Dashboard, CI/CD and other tooling, with the individual clusters.

Most of these integrations are configured directly in the Platform, either in the Dashboard/CLI or in the Helm configuration file.

## Clusters Architecture

For each cluster connected to the Rig Platform, the _Rig Operator_ must be installed. This is in charge of apply Capsules, running plugins and watching object status on behalf of the Platform.

The plugins are run in the context of the Rig Operator, and allows for easy customization of the Capsule implementation, without the need for Helm. Additionally, the _online_ nature of the Rig Operator means
that plugins are also continuously observe the Kubernetes Objects and Events for any state change.
