# Getting started

This getting started guide is meant to get you up and running with Rig as fast as possible. It will walk you through installing the Rig CLI and 
installing the Rig Platform for local development in [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io).

## Install the Rig CLI

The Rig CLI is used to interact with the Rig Platform. It can be used to both setup a local Rig Platform installation, as well as interact with the Rig platform.
