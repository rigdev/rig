# Rig guide

## Setup Installation

The Rig Platform is installed using a Helm chart, into any Kubernetes cluster that has
the Rig Operator installed.

## Dependencies

### Rig Operator

Ensure you have already [installed the Rig Operator](/operator-manual/setup-guide/operator)
before installing the Platform, as the Platform itself is installed as a Capsule.

### PostgreSQL

The Platform depends on a single PostgreSQL database, for where it will store all of its
configuration.

#### In-cluster database

It's possible to have the Helm Chart spin up a database by setting the following flag
when running `helm`: `--set postgres.enabled=true`. This is not recommended for production
environments though.

#### Managed database

The better option is to use a managed database in the cluster environment you're
already running in. It can also be a new database within an existing PostgreSQL instance.
Add the following section to your `platform.yaml` file:

```yaml
client:
  postgres:
    database: "rig"  ## change if different database is used.
    host: <host or ip>
    user: <db user>
    password: <db password>
    # insecure: false  ## set only if DB connection is insecure
```

:::info Note
See the [Database](/operator-manual/database) article for more information about how to connect to your
own database, and other configuration options.
