# Capsule Step Plugins
The way the operator handles the different steps in the reconcilliation pipeline is interchangable. 
This means, that the operator can be configured to handle the steps in different ways by 
using different plugins. This is specified in the steps fields in the pipeline in the operator config.

## Reconcilliation pipeline and default steps
The reconcilliation pipeline is a list of steps that the operator will go through when reconciling a `capsule` resource.
The default steps if nothing is specified are:
- Service Account Step - `rigdev.service_account`
- Deployment Step - `rigdev.deployment`
- CronJob Step - `rigdev.cronjob`

Additionally, if provided the pipeline will also consist of the:
- Routes Step - `rigdev.ingress_routes`
- Service Monitor Step - `rigdev.service_monitor`

## Example
```yaml
config:
  pipeline:
    routesStep:
      plugin: "rigdev.ingress_routes"
      config: |
        clusterIssuer: letsencrypt-prod
        createCertificateResources: true
        ingressClassName: nginx
        disableTLS: false
    serviceMonitorStep
      plugin: "rigdev.service_monitor"
      config: |
       portName: "system"
       path: "metrics"
```

This pipeline will use the default steps for Service Account, Deployment and CronJob, but will also include the Routes and Service Monitor steps.
