# Container Registries

By default, the Rig Platform can use Container Images from any public Container Repositories.
For example, when creating a new Build using the repository `nginx`, the Rig Platform will be able to resolve this at registry `index.docker.io`.

## Private Repositories

When a Container Repository is private, authentication for the Container Registry needs to be added to the Rig Platform.

This is done by adding the credentials of the registry to the platform configuration.

For Container Registries registered in the Rig Platform, if configured in the cluster-info, image-pull-secrets will automatically be generated for the Capsules that uses images from these registries.

### Example

Let's imagine that we have the private Container Repository `index.docker.io/rigdev/test-container`, that we want to use in a Capsule.

First, we need the _registry_ section of the repository, which is the `host` part of the url; `index.docker.io`.

Then, using the guide for _this_ registry, available [here](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/), we can see that we can create a new token for our account.

When created, the username and token can be used to register the registry in the Rig Platform configuration:

```yaml
rig:
  dockerRegistries:
    index.docker.io:
      username: <registry-username>
      password: <registry-password>

  clusters:
    prod:
      type: k8s
      createPullSecrets: true

```

With this change, the Rig Platform can now generate the image-pull-secrets needed to pull the container.

## Dev Registry

The Rig Platform supports the concept of a _dev_ registry. This registry is used by the CLI when interacting with the platform, to push images directly to a registry, an operation very useful for development.

When starting a local dev cluster (using the `rig dev ...` CLI command), a dev registry is automatically created and registered.

When running the command `rig deploy`, you can access local images and have them automatically pushed to the dev registry as part of deploying the local image:
