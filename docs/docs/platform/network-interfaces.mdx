# Network Interfaces

A container can expose multiple ports, each of them allowing a unique set of traffic. To expose these ports into Kubernetes, a Network Interface must be created - one per port.

The Network Interface allows for configuring additional behavior, such as if the network should be publicly available through Routes and liveness and readiness checks.

      }}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Routes

To make the network interface publicly available, the interface must have a Route attached to it. A Route is simply an interface that specifies how the network interface should be exposed to the outside world
and can be implemented using [plugins](/operator-manual/setup-guide/operator/plugins). A default [Route-Plugin](/operator-manual/setup-guide/operator/networking) is provided, which exposes the interface using an Ingress.

To configure a _Route_ simply press `Add Host`, and specify the hostname that the interface should be exposed on.
Additionally one or more paths can be specified, which will be matched against incoming requests. These can either be exact, prefix or regexp matches.
