# GitLab CI/CD Pipelines

When using GitLab, we recommend that the `rig` CLI is used in its
docker image format.

## Preparing variables

We recommend that you define the following variables to be available
for pipelines.

- `RIG_HOST` containing the full URL to your Rig API.
- `RIG_CLIENT_ID` containing the client ID of your service account.
- `RIG_CLIENT_SECRET` containing the client secret of your service account.

For more information about how to set variables please refer to the [GitLab
CI/CD Variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) documentation.

## Using `rig` CLI in a job

The easiest way to use the Rig CLI in your GitLab jobs is by running your job
in our CLI image. See the following for a simple example of a GitLab Pipeline.

<pre><code className="language-yaml">
{`deploy:
  image: ghcr.io/rigdev/rig:` + RIG_VERSION + `
  script:
    # Activate the service account from RIG_CLIENT_ID, RIG_CLIENT_SECRET and
    # RIG_HOST. This will enable you to use the CLI on behalf of the service
    # account.
    - rig auth activate-service-account -H $RIG_HOST
    # When the service account is activated you can go ahead and issue commands
    # on the CLI.
    - rig capsule deploy ...`}
</code></pre>

Now that you know how to run the `rig` CLI in GitLab. You can go ahead and
checkout our documentation for how to effectively [use the CLI in CI Systems](../ci-cd#deploying-changes).
