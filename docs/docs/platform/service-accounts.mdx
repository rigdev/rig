# Service Accounts

Service Accounts are used to access the Rig Platform from a remote service, without using User username & password login credentials.

An example is a CI/CD pipeline like GitHub Actions, where access to your Rig Platfrom can be established using a Service Account.

## Create Service Accounts

Service Accounts for external use are created through the dashboard and can be found under your project settings as seen below:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Dashboard Service Account Image"
  sources={{
    light: "/img/service-account/no-service-account.png",
    dark: "/img/service-account/no-service-account.png",
  }}
/>

Click on the **Add Service Account** and provide a name. Afterward, you will see the success screen with your new service account:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Dashboard Service Account Image"
  customProps={{
    zoom: true,
  }}
  sources={{
    light: "/img/service-account/service-account-created.png",
    dark: "/img/service-account/service-account-created.png",
  }}
/>

**Remember to copy the `Client Secret` as this is the first and last time you will be able to**.

## Use Service Accounts with The Rig CLI

Service Accounts can be used with the Rig CLI in for example a CI/CD flow.
This is done by providing the service account crendentials as environment variables,
and using basic authentication. The following is an example of creating a new capsule and deploying an nginx image with a network configuration and a config map.

```sh
#! /bin/bash

# Create a capsule
rig --host https://rig.dev --basic-auth \
 --project nginx-project \
 --environment staging \
 capsule create -c nginx-capsule

# Add a config map
rig --host https://rig.dev --basic-auth \
 --project nginx-project \
 --environment staging \
 capsule -c nginx-capsule \
 mount set --src ~/path/to/configmap/src.html \
 --dst /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

# Add a network configuration
rig --host https://rig.dev --basic-auth \
 --project nginx-project \
 --environment staging \ 
 capsule -c nginx-capsule \
 network configure ~/path/to/network/network.yaml

# Deploy the configured capsule
rig --host https://rig.dev --basic-auth \
 --project nginx-project \
 --environment staging \
 capsule -c nginx-capsule deploy -i nginx
```
