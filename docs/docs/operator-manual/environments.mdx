# Environments

The Rig Platform supports a multi-environment architecture out-of-the-box.

Environments are associated to a single cluster, meaning Rig supports multiple clusters
through environments.

While any mix-and-match are supported, it essentially boils down to two variants,
singletenancy and multitenancy. There are no limits to the number of environments,
clusters or environments per cluster.

## Singletenancy

In a singletenancy setup, the given cluster hosts only a single environment. A simple
example of this is two clusters, production and staging, that respectively hosts a
production and a staging environment.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Singletenancy"
  customProps={{
    zoom: false,
  }}
  sources={{
    light: "/img/operator-manual/environments-single-light.svg",
    dark: "/img/operator-manual/environments-single-dark.svg",
  }}
/>

In this setup, the Rig Platform communicates with both clusters, to configure the two
environments individually. The configuration for the Rig Platform Helms values file
looks like this:

```yaml
rig:
  clusters:
    staging:
      type: k8s
    production:
      type: k8s
  environments:
    staging:
      cluster: staging
    production:
      cluster: production
      default: true
```
:::info Default environment
The `default` marker is used by the Dashboard and CLI for which to pick when nodes
environment is specified, e.g. loading the dashboard will in this case show the production
environment.
:::

## Multitenancy

In a multitenancy setup, a single cluster is hosting a number of environments. This is
a convenient way of sharing node resources across environments and simplifying the overall
infrastructure.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Multitenancy"
  customProps={{
    zoom: false,
  }}
  sources={{
    light: "/img/operator-manual/environments-multi-light.svg",
    dark: "/img/operator-manual/environments-multi-dark.svg",
  }}
/>

When communicating with the cluster, it's important that the namespace generated is
unique across environments, so resources don't end up conflicting. This is done
by using the `namespace_template` property, that by default is configured to
`"{{ .Project.Name }}"`. In the example below, the environment is suffixed to all
namespace names.

```yaml
rig:
  clusters:
    production:
      type: k8s
  environments:
    staging:
      cluster: production
      namespace_template: "{{ .Project.Name }}-{{ .Environment.Name }}"
    production:
      cluster: production
      namespace_template: "{{ .Project.Name }}-{{ .Environment.Name }}"
      default: true
```
