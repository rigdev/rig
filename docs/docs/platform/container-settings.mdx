# Container Settings

All the configuration of how a Container is executed within a Capsule, is managed from the Settings page.

## Environment Variables

Basic environment variables can be added to the Capsule.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dashboard" label="Dashboard">
    <ThemedImage
      alt="Environment Variables settings"
      customProps={{
        zoom: true,
      }}
      sources={{
        light: "/img/dashboard/platform/container-settings/env-vars.png",
        dark: "/img/dashboard/platform/container-settings/env-vars.png",
      }}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When Saved, the environment is deployed to the Capsule.
