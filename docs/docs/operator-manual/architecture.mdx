# Architecture

The Rig architecture consists of a few key components. The two main components are the *Rig Platform* and the *Rig Operator*. The Rig Operator is a Kubernetes operator monitoring the Capsule resources within the cluster, generating all the necessary capsule-derived resources.
The Rig Platform exposes a high-level API to work with capsules and Rig projects and handles capsule rollouts, instance and cluster monitoring and more.
