# Declarative Deployment

Since a Capsule can be described declaratively, it is, similarly to `kubectl apply`,
possible to deploy a capsule using a yaml file describing it.

For example, we can create a `my-capsule.yaml`, describing an nginx capsule, mounted with an 
index.html file for static content, a network interface to provide readiness and liveness 
checks and to expose port 80, and a scale configuration for resources and replica count.

```yaml title="my-capsule.yaml"
apiVersion: platform.rig.dev/v1
kind: Capsule
environment: prod
name: my-capsule
project: acme
spec:
  files:
  - path: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
    string: |
     <html>
       <body>
         <h1>Hello World!</h1>
       </body>
     </html>
  image: nginx:latest
  interfaces:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    readiness:
      path: /
    liveness:
      path: /
  scale:
    horizontal:
      instances:
        min: 2
    vertical:
      cpu:
        request: 200m
      memory:
        request: 256Mi
```
Notice the project and environment and name fields, which are used to identify and place the capsule in Rig.

It can then be deployed using the following command:

```bash
rig deploy -f my-capsule.yaml
```

This will initiate a new rollout in Rig, deploying the described capsule.

If the capsule already exists, the rollout will consist of the changes from the current capsule to the desired capsule.
If the capsule does not already exist it will first be created, and then the rollout will consists of all 
the properties described in capsule spec.

The full list of fields that can be used in the Capsule yaml file can be found 
in the [Capsule API Reference](/api/platformv1/#capsule).
