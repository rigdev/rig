# Placement Plugin

The `rigdev.placement` plugin adds placement configuration to the Deployment resource of your capsule.
It can modify the `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` fields of the deployment.
It has a `requireTag` bool config value. If set to `true`, the plugin will only run on capsules `rigdev.placement/tag` annotation matches the `tag` of the placement plugin. This also means the `tag` must be set on the plugin if `requireTag` is true.

## Example
Config (in context of the rig-operator Helm values):
```
config:
  pipeline:
    steps:
      - plugins:
        - name: rigdev.placement
          config: |
            nodeSelector:
              key1: value1
            tolerations:
              - key: some-key
                value: some-value
```

The `Deployment` resource of the Capsule
```
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        key2: value2
      tolerations:
        - key: some-other-key
          value: some-other-value
   ...
```
The resulting config of the `Deployment` is
```
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        key1: value1
        key2: value2
      tolerations:
        - key: some-other-key
          value: some-other-value
        - key: some-key
          value: some-value
   ...
```
