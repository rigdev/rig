![Authentication](/img/banners/authentication-banner.png "Authentication")

Rig comes with an authentication module, and using this, you can easily add authentication to your application.
The module enables you to manage all aspects of authentication: Registering users in your system, authenticating users with authentication flows based on different
credentials such as email/password, username/password or social logins, and lastly managing your your authentication settings.

This part of the documentation covers the features in Rig's authentication module and how they can be used.
