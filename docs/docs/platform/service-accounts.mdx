# Service Accounts

Service Accounts are used to access the Rig Platform from a remote service, without using User username & password login credentials.

An example is a CI/CD pipeline like GitHub Actions, where access to your Rig Platfrom can be established using a Service Account.

## Create Service Accounts

Service Accounts for external use are created through the dashboard and can be found under your project settings as seen below:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Dashboard Service Account Image"
  sources={{
    light: "/img/service-account/no-service-account.png",
    dark: "/img/service-account/no-service-account.png",
  }}
/>

Click on the **Add Service Account** and provide a name. Afterward, you will see the success screen with your new service account:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Dashboard Service Account Image"
  customProps={{
    zoom: true,
  }}
  sources={{
    light: "/img/service-account/service-account-created.png",
    dark: "/img/service-account/service-account-created.png",
  }}
/>

**Remember to copy the `Client Secret` as this is the first and last time you will be able to**.
