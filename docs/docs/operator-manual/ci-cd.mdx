Rig is easily integratable in _any_ CI/CD environment, due to it's rich [CLI
tool](/getting-started/cli-install). From the CLI, you can deploy to any
Capsule in any environment.

## Preparing your CI/CD system

When using the CLI in a CI/CD environment, you will first need to create a Rig
service account which the CLI will use to authenticate against the Rig APIs. If
you need help creating a service account, please see the instructions in [the
Service Account documentation](/platform/service-accounts).

Your service account will have a client ID and secret which we will need when
configuring the CI/CD system. Take note of these.

Lastly you will need the URL for where the CI/CD system should contact the Rig
APIs.

With these in hand follow the guide for your CI/CD system of choice:

- [GitHub Actions](./ci-cd/github-actions)
- [GitLab CI/CD pipelines](./ci-cd/gitlab-pipelines)

If you are interested in better support for a CI/CD system not mentioned in the
above list, please open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/rigdev/rig.

## Rig Platform host and credentials

If you followed the above instructions for one of the supported CI/CD systems,
you can disregard this section.

The Rig Platform hostname is controlled using the `--host`/`-H` flag. It should
include the scheme, e.g. `https://my-host/`. Alternatively, `RIG_HOST` can be
set.

The Rig CLI automatically looks for a `RIG_CLIENT_ID` and  `RIG_CLIENT_SECRET`
environment variables, of the [Service Account](/platform/service-accounts) to
use.

## Deploying changes

All changes to a Capsule can be done through the powerful `rig deploy` command.
It takes a number of arguments, combining them all into a single Rollout to the
Capsule.

As an example, the following command

```bash
rig deploy my-capsule --image nginx:1.25 -e FOO=bar
```

will update `my-capsule` to use the container image `nginx:1.25` and set the
environment variable `FOO` to the value `bar`.

See `rig deploy --help` for a list of all the options available.

## Environments and Projects

When deploying to a Capsule from a CI/CD environment, it's often useful to
indicate which project the Capsule is located in and which environment to
deploy to.

This is done using the `--project`/`-P` and `--environment`/`-E` flags:

```bash
rig deploy my-capsule -P my-project -E staging --image image:v1.25
```

Alternatively, the project and environment can be given using the `RIG_PROJECT`
and `RIG_ENVIRONMENT` environment variables.

## Rollout progress

By default, the `rig deploy` command will wait for the rollout to "succeed".
For the Rig Platform, that means it will wait until all changes are applied,
all new resources are up and all instances are up and running.

While the rollout is progressing, the command will print events as they happen.
It's thus possible to use the tool as an feedback in a CI/CD workflow, of if
the rollback failed or contained changes:

```bash
rig deploy my-capsule --image nginx:1.25
Deploying to capsule test in rollout 52
✅ configmap/my-capsule: Done
✅ capsule.rig.dev/my-capsule: Done
✅ Commit rollout changes: Wrote rollout changes to Kubernetes
✅ Wait for Capsule resource creation: Done
✅ Using object 'configmap/my-capsule': Done
✅ Created object 'serviceaccount/my-capsule': Done
✅ Created object 'deployment/my-capsule': Done
✅ Instances: All instances are running

Done ✅ - All instances are running
```

Note that most errors are treated as recoverable, as resources in Kubernetes
may progress to a working state. The command will thus not exit and keep
running, even though an recoverable error happened. A sane timeout should thus
be applied.

To disable waiting for rollout to succeed, use `--no-wait`.


## Complete example

The following is a complete example of deploying an image change, with all
required arguments of the non-interactive CLI.

```bash
export RIG_CLIENT_ID=rig_...
export RIG_CLIENT_SECRET=secret_...
export RIG_HOST=https://rig.my-company.com
rig auth activate-service-account -H $RIG_HOST
rig deploy my-capsule \
  --project my-project \
  --environment production \
  --image nginx:1.25
```
