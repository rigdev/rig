# Plugins

Plugins inject custom logic into the operator and is our way of extending the capability of a capsule with functionality not expressable throug the Capsule CRD.
See [here](/operator-manual/setup-guide/plugins) for how to configure the operator to execute plugins.

Rig supplies a list of builtin plugins always available to the rig administrator. See [here](builtin) for a catalog. 

If none of the builtin plugins fit your needs, it is possible to write your own third-party plugins and inject them into the operator. You can find a guide for that [here](/operator-manual/plugins/thirdparty).
