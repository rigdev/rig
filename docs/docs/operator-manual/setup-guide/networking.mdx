# Networking

Part of the Capsule spec is `Routes` which configures how an interface of a Capsule can be mapped to outside the cluster using e.g. Ingress. You can see the `HostRoute` spec [here](/api/v1alpha2#hostroute).
The mapping between Routes and Ingress resources can be quite custom, as it depends on, among other things, the specific Ingress controller installed in the Kubernetes cluster.

Therefore, the Routes step of the rig operator is configurable as a plugin. We supply a builtin plugin [`rigdev.ingress_routes`](/operator-manual/plugins/builtin/ingress_routes) which creates an Ingress resource for each Route and has some configuration for handling certificates, TLS and ingress class name.

See [here](plugins) for a general introduction to plugins and how to configure them. The Routes step in the operator is configurable in the operator config under the [`RoutesStep`](/api/config/v1alpha1#routesstep) in the Operator Config. You can see an example here
```yaml
config:
  pipeline:
    routesStep:
      plugin: rigdev.ingress_routes
      config: |
        clusterIssuer: letsencrypt-prod
        createCertificateResources: true
        ingressClassName: nginx
        disableTLS: false
```
If our builtin plugin for handling routes doesn't fit your needs, you can write your own third-party plugin supplying a different behaviour. You can find a guide for that [here](/operator-manual/plugins/thirdparty)
