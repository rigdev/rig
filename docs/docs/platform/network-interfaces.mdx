# Network Interfaces

A container can expose multiple ports, each of them allowing a unique set of traffic. To expose these ports into Kubernetes, a Network Interface must be created - one per port.

The Network Interface allows for configuring additional behavior, such as if the network should be publicly available and health checks.

## Public Interface

If a Network Interface is marked as public, external traffic will be routed to the interface, and thus the container port configured.

When exposing an interface to the internet, it's important to consider how the external traffic is processed, as exposing interfaces publicly can result in security issues.

There are two ways in Kubernetes to expose Network Interfaces, either as a Load Balancer or as an Ingress.

### Ingress

An Ingress is a _managed_ load balancer, that accepts HTTPS traffic only. When configuring, one thus has to select which DNS host address the interface should be exposed as.

The Ingress handles the termination of the TLS connection, meaning the request is forwarded to the interface as plain HTTP traffic.

:::info Prerequisites
Make sure you have an Ingress and Certificate manager configured.

### Load Balancer

A Load Balancer is a raw TCP forwarding of traffic, to the interface. This means it can support any protocol running on top of TCP.
It also means that the Capsule itself must deal with encryption, security and certificates, depending on the protocol being implemented.

Using a Load Balancer is disencouraged in favor of an Ingress, when the HTTPS protocol is used.
