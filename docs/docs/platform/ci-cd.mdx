Rig is easily integratable in _any_ CI/CD environment, due to it's rich CLI tool. From the CLI, you can issues deploys to any Capsule in any environment.

For CI/CD steps where Rig runs in a workflow environment, the Rig CLI automatically looks for a `RIG_CLIENT_ID` and  `RIG_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables,
of the [service-account](/platform/service-accounts) to use.

## Deploying changes

All changes to a Capsule can be done through the powerful `rig deploy` command. It takes a number of arguments, combining them all into a single Rollout to
the Capsule.

As an example, the following command

```bash
rig deploy my-capsule --image nginx:1.25 -e FOO=bar
```

will update `my-capsule` to use the container image `nginx:1.25` and set the environment variable `FOO` to the value `bar`.

See `rig deploy --help` for a list of all the options available.

## Rollout progress

By default, the `rig deploy` command will wait for the rollout to "succeed". For the Rig Platform, that means it will wait
until all changes are applied, all new resources are up and all instances are up and running.

While the rollout is progressing, the command will print events as they happen. It's thus possible to use the tool as an feedback
in a CI/CD workflow, of if the rollback failed or contained changes:

```bash
rig deploy my-capsule --image nginx:1.25
Deploying to capsule test in rollout 52
✅ configmap/my-capsule: Done
✅ capsule.rig.dev/my-capsule: Done
✅ Commit rollout changes: Wrote rollout changes to Kubernetes
✅ Wait for Capsule resource creation: Done
✅ Using object 'configmap/my-capsule': Done
✅ Created object 'serviceaccount/my-capsule': Done
✅ Created object 'deployment/my-capsule': Done
✅ Instances: All instances are running

Done ✅ - All instances are running
```

Note that most errors are treated as recoverable, as resources in Kubernetes may progress to a working state. The command will thus
not exit and keep running, even though an recoverable error happened. A sane timeout should thus be applied.

To disable waiting for rollout to succeed, use `--no-wait`.

## Environments and Projects

When deploying to a Capsule from a CI/CD environment, it's often useful to indicate which project the Capsule is located in and which environment to deploy to.

This is done using the `--project`/`-P` and `--environment`/`-E` flags:

```bash
rig deploy my-capsule -P my-project -E staging --image image:v1.25
```
