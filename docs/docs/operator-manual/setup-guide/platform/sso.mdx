# Single Sign-On

Enabling single sign-on in rig platform enables users to login to rig by
proving that they can login at a thrid party. Currenlty users will be created
if the do not already exist when a user logs in using SSO. This means that you
wont have to manually create users in your organization.

## OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a standardised extension of oauth, which is widely
supported by a lot of differnt identity providers. Rig platform can be
configured to let users log in using one or more OIDC providers.

If you installed rig-platform using helm, you will be able to configure the
required parameter through helm values. Each of the below provider examples
will include an example of the helm values needed to configure that specific
provider.

### Google

In order to setup Google as an OIDC provider you will first need to create an
OAuth 2.0 Client ID. This is done on the [API Credentials
page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) in the Google cloud
console.

- For "Application type" choose "Web application".
- Enter a "Name" which will be shown in the OAuth flow.
- Add "Authorized Redirect URI" set to
  `https://<your-domain>/api/v1/sso/oidc/callback`

It should look like the below screenshot (with your own domain). Take note of your "Client ID" and "Client secret", we will need to insert these in our platform config.

Example of how to add the configuration of your google OIDC provider to the
rig-platform configuration.

```yaml
rig:
  publicURL: "https://<your-domain>"
  auth:
    sso:
      oidcProviders:
        google:
          name: "Google"
          icon: "google"
          clientID: "<Client ID>"
          clientSecret: "<Client secret>"
          issuerURL: "https://accounts.google.com"
```
