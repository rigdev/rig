# Object Template Plugin

The `rigdev.object_template` patches a YAML spec to a Kubernetes object defined by a Group, Kind and Name.

The config can be templated with standard Go templating and has
```
.capsule
.current
```
as its templating context where `.current` refers to the current version of the object being modified.

## Example
Config:
```
object: | 
  spec:
   externalName: some-name 
group: core
kind: Service
name: {{ .capsule.metadata.name }}
```
The resulting Service resource of the Capsule, if the Capsule is named `my-capsule`
```
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-capsule
...
spec:
  externalName: some-name
  ...
```
