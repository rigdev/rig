# Example local dev setup with Prometheus and custom metrics

This example uses the local Rig development environment to setup a Prometheus stack emitting custom metrics used to autoscale a capsule.

Using the Rig cli you can spin up a [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) cluster with Rig installed for local development. This can also be spun up with a prometheus stack
```bash
rig dev kind create --prometheus
```
After the command has finished you should be able to see a lot of Prometheus resources created in the `prometheus` namespace
```
kubectl get all -n prometheus
```
should output something like
```
NAME                                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

pod/prometheus-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-0               2/2     Running   0          125m

...
```
Using the `--prometheus` flag also sets the `prometheusServiceMonitor` setting on the Rig operator so it spawns a `ServiceMonitor` per capsule monitoring ports named `metrics`. The Prometheus resource created by `rig dev kind create` is configured to select `ServiceMonitors` with the `rig.dev/capsule` label set (which the operator always sets).
```
kubectl get prometheus kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus -n prometheus -oyaml | yq '.spec.serviceMonitorSelector'
```
should output
```
matchExpressions:
  - key: rig.dev/capsule
    operator: Exists
```

To test the custom metrics we are going to make at setup with two capsule, a `producer` and a `consumer`. The `produer` capsule sends periodically a request to the `consumer`. For each request, the `consumer` incrementes a queue counter and asynchronously decrements the queue counter once every 0.5-1.5s. This is to simulate a set of consumers each with their own queue of tasks they will process. The consumers emit their queue size as a metric we will horizontally scale them with. If the queues get too big it's indicative that there are too few consumers.

Create two capsules like so
```
rig capsule create -c consumer
rig capsule create -c producer
```
Then deploy the following consumer/producer image to them ([the code](https://github.com/rigdev/custommetrics-demo), for the interested)
```
rig capsule build create -c consumer --image almostuseful/consumer --deploy
rig capsule build create -c producer --image almostuseful/producer --deploy
```
At this point we should be able to see two `ServiceMonitors` (one for each capsule) created in the kubernetes namespace of the Rig project (called `demo` in this case).
```
kubectl get servicemonitor -n demo
```
outputs
```
NAME       AGE
consumer   12m
producer   12m
```
The `consumer` capsule has not exposed a port yet which we need to do. Store
```yaml
interfaces:
    - port: 2112
      name: metrics
```
in a file, e.g. `network.yaml` and deploy it to the capsule
```
rig capsule network configure network.yaml -c consumer
```
We use port 2112 both for Prometheus metric emission and the endpoint which the `producer` calls on the `consumer`. The name of the port, `metrics`, is not arbitrary as the `ServiceMonitors` are setup to monitor endpoints called `metrics`. Run
```
kubectl get servicemonitor consumer -n demo -oyaml | yq '.spec'
```
to verify.
With this we should be able to see Prometheus pick up a metric `queue_size` from the consumer. You can port-forward the port which Prometheus exposes
```
kubectl port-forward pod/prometheus-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-0 -n prometheus 9090:9090
```
and then go to [localhost:9090](localhost:9090) and query for `queue_size`.

Although the metric is now picked up by Prometheus, it has yet to be picked up by the Prometheus Adapter so it can be consumed through the `custom.metrics.k8s.io` API. We need to configure some rules for the prometheus adapter to pick up our `queue_size` metric.
Save the following minimal config in a file, e.g. `adapter-config.yaml` and apply it
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-adapter
data:
  config.yaml: |
    rules:
    - seriesQuery: 'queue_size'
      metricsQuery: <<.Series>>
```
```
kubectl apply -f adapter-config.yaml -n prometheus
```
It can take some minutes for the adapter to scrape the metrics, but it should find the `queue_size` metric. We are now ready to setup the autoscaler to listen on the custom metrics. The following configuration enables the autoscaler and it will try to maintain that the average `queue_length` doesn't exceed 5
```yaml
maxReplicas: 5
minReplicas: 1
customMetrics:
- instance:
    averageValue: "5"
    metricName: queue_size
```
```
rig capsule scale horizontal autoscale -c consumer --path autoscalerconfig.yaml
```
After this deployment we should be able to see the autoscaler operating and fetching values from the custom metric
```
kubectl get horizontalpodautoscaler -n demo
```
```
NAME       REFERENCE             TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
consumer   Deployment/consumer   4/5       1         5         1          96s
```

Finally, to see the autoscaling kick in we need to up the frequency with which the `producer` sends requests to the `consumers`. The default is 1 second, but we can increase it by setting an environment variable `REQUEST_TIME` on the producer
```
rig capsule env set REQUEST_TIME 250ms -c producer
```
An easy way to quickly inspect the queue size of each consumer is to look at the logs of the capsule. For each element a consumer 'pops' from its queue, it prints the queue size
```
rig capsule logs -c consumer ---follow
```

```

```
At the start we have only one consumer with a large queue. This prompts the autoscaler to spin up more instances which then can take on requests, easing the load on the first instance.

This walkthrough shows how you can setup Prometheus and the Adapter to work well with Rig to enable autoscaling on custom metrics. Of course, if you have a different metric setup, Rig can still spin up an autoscaler which monitors for custom metrics.
